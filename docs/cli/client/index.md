# telemetry client

Client commands for interacting with a telemetry server at a low level.

## Synopsis

Typical users will use ace-dt to interact with the REST API of the telemetry server.  The subcommands here offer a lower-level API for administrators and developers.

## Options

```plaintext
      --client-config stringArray   client configuration file location (setable with env "ACE_TELEMETRY_CLIENT_CONFIG")
                                    May specify multiple files separated by ":".  
                                    The first configuration file present is used.  Others are ignored.
                                     (default [ace-telemetry-client-config.yaml,HOMEDIR/.config/ace/telemetry/client-config.yaml,/etc/ace/telemetry/client-config.yaml])
  -h, --help                        help for client
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

  -v, --verbosity strings[=warn]   Logging verbosity level (also setable with environment variable ACE_TELEMETRY_VERBOSITY)
